# dotfiles

My personal dotfiles for a consistent and comfortable terminal setup across machines.

This repo contains configuration for:

- `zsh` – with custom prompt and Ctrl+Arrow keybindings
- `bash` – readline enhancements via `.inputrc`
- `tmux` – sensible defaults and usability tweaks
- Common aliases and keybindings

---

## Setup

Clone the repository and run the install script to symlink the dotfiles into place:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/louisxponce/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
